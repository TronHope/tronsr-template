TronHope.org aims to sponsor real-world social initiatives, and uplift the lives of those less fortunate by using the rewards from running as a Tron Super Representative, and also to grow the Tron-brand outside of the typical crypto community space. If we, the Tron Community, can give back to society in a positive and meaningful way, then society will learn to appreciate and see real value in TRX, and how it can be used in everyday lives

To become a Tron Super Representative in the 21 to 27 range* in order to:
  - Generate Rewards for You, our Supporters
  - Uplift Communities through the Rewards generated from participating as a Super Representative
  
Just as in Africa, the TronHope.org Team is a diverse mix of people with various cultural backgrounds

We currently have leadership representatives from the key African economies, namely Kenya, Mauritius (yes, we're including Mauritius in Africa), Nigeria, and South Africa, with a goal to expand the team with like minded, socially responsible and capable individuals

We are merely born of Africa, not limited to Africa. Our goal is to make the world a better place one step at a time

A shout out to CryptoGuyInZA for leading the African pack. We look forward to hopefully being able to work together to advance Tron, TRX, and the Community
